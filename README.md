# pure

This script is a library that you can import in your personnal bash script. It only contains the functions and some texts from the [Pure Bash Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible) with very little indication or information. 

**I did not write a single line of code, all the credit goes to the people that did write the Bible in the first place.**

I did some tests and importing the library just takes **0.002 seconds**, so having all of the functions in one place won't slow your scripts down (which would be counter-productive since the very first goal of the Bible is to let you speed up your scripts).

All the functions start with the prefix `pure.` in order to not interfer with your own functions.

For more information please go directly to the original [repository](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible).
